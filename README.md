### Hello World üëã

Hi there! I'm Sreenadh, somebody who's just trying to get through this crazy world while some having fun and learning a thing or two along the way. I'm a full stack engineer by profession, but my interests and goals are much larger than just code. **I want to make a positive impact in the world**, and code is just one avenue that I use to achieve that.

### Quick Facts ‚è©

#### Code Graveyard Disclaimer ‚ò†Ô∏è

So it seems as though you found my GitHub profile! That's exciting for you, and scary for me, seeing as a far amount of this profile is graveyard projects from college or what I have tried out previously. No worries! Feel free to look around still - I can't stop you - but remember that **much of this code was written was I was just a student**. Most of my newer code is proprietary (for the moment) so I can't really share it, but feel free to read the sections below on what I'm focusing on.

### Say Hi üì´

Honestly, the best way to reach out to me is probably either via a Direct Message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sreenadh-m/). Feel free to email me as well.

### What have I been up to?

#### Current Projects üë®‚Äçüíª

I am working on internal/proprietary projects in my current company. I am exploring new cloud infrastructures like IBM Cloud, catching up with technology stacks that will help my projects migrate.

Also, I am spending my time on experimenting web3 libraries and going through courses to get certified in solidity.
